**Here in this project, you can simply click on Get Me a Movie button to get randomly selected movie for you with information related to the movie like genre, overall score, plot etc.**

To implement the code, you should have your API key:

  Before using the TMDb API, you'll need to sign up for an account and obtain an API key from their website (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Replace the placeholder 'YOUR-API-KEY' in the JavaScript code with your actual API key.
