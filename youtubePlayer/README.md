**Remember to replace "YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID" with the actual playlist ID from your playlist link and "YOUR_API_KEY" with your YouTube Data API key.**

To fetch the playlist information from YouTube using the YouTube Data API, you will need to obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console. Here's how you can get the API key:

Go to the Google Cloud Console. https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=sixth-tribute-388709
Create a new project or select an existing project.
Enable the YouTube Data API for your project:
Click on the "APIs & Services" menu on the left sidebar.
Select "Library" from the submenu.
Search for "YouTube Data API" and click on it.
Click the "Enable" button.
Create an API key:
Go back to the "APIs & Services" menu.
Select "Credentials" from the submenu.
Click the "Create credentials" button and choose "API key".
Copy the generated API key.
Once you have obtained the API key, replace the 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY' placeholder in the JavaScript code I provided earlier with your actual API key.
